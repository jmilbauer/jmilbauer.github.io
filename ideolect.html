    <h1>Ideolect - mapping ideology and concept structure</h2>
    <h2>As more and more of our lives are spent on the Internet, and more and more of our thoughts and values are shaped by the people and posts we interact with there, it is increasingly important to understand the landscape of worldviews that the Internet is home to — as well as to identify the trends and actors influencing those worldviews.</h2>
    <h2><i>Ideolect</i> is an ongoing effort to invent techniques for discovering and representing ideological communities and echo chambers on the Internet, and to identify trends in their development. I am currently focusing on data collected from January 2016 to December 2016, hoping to uncover rich information that sheds light on ideological development leading up to the 2016 US Presidential Election.</h2>
