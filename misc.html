    <p>My Erdos number is 4.
      My Bacon number might be 4 – giving me an <a href="erdosbacon.html">Erdos-Bacon number of 8</a> – if stage productions counted.
      They do not; it is not. How sad!</p>

    <p>One of my goals is to know 10 potato recipes.
      Currently I know four: home fries, roast potatoes, baked potatoes, and fondant potatoes.</p>

    <p>Some people who have helped me along the way: John Lafferty (UChicago), John Goldsmith (UChicago), James Evans (UChicago), Emma Strubell (CMU)</p>
    <!-- <p>When I was young I visited the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. I vividly remember finding a tall staircase – far too tall for my young-child-legs – that was draped witha  red carpet and lined with an assortment of eclectic grandfather clocks on every side. Strangely the people around me did not seem to notice the staircase, or perhaps they did not care. I longed to venture up it. So I vowed to return – when my legs grew longer and when I grew bold enough to explore mysterious things. That day arrived, and since then I have always looked for the staircase whenever I visit the museum. But I have never found it again. </p> -->
