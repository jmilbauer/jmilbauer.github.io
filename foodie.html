    <h1>Simmer - an app for foodies</h2>
    <h2>There's a huge problem with the current state of food discovery platforms like Yelp and Google Maps -- they rate restaurants, not dishes. If I want the best burger in town, what can I do? Simmer solves this problem by using machine learning to extract dish-level preference information and allow users to search for great food at a more granular level. Check out <a href="https://usesimmer.com">the app</a>!</h2>
    <h2>Simmer (under the name "Foodie") was accepted to YCombinator Winter 2019, one of the world's top startup accelerators.</h2>
    <h2>I left Simmer in Spring 2019 to focus on my research work.</h2>
