<p><span class="contradicted highlight" id="highlight-0">The King's coronation will be a three-day extravaganza of ceremony, celebration and tradition.</span><span>From the opening procession to the bank holiday Big Help Out, here's everything you need to know about what's happened so far and what is still to come.</span></p><p><span>Sky News reporter
              @jos_franks</span></p><p><span>Saturday 6 May 2023 18:33, UK</span></p><p><span>The King has been crowned, but celebrations will take place all weekend - including a concert and nationwide lunches.</span></p><p><span>Here's what's happened and what's still to come.</span></p><p><span>The ceremony</span></p><p><span>The coronation ceremony of the King - and his wife, Queen Camilla - took place at Westminster Abbey.</span></p><p><span>Royals, celebrities and foreign dignitaries arrived for the momentous event.</span></p><p><span>There were big hats, fabulous outfits, lots of crowds and lots of rain.</span></p><p><span>Here's what you might have missed:</span></p><p><span>The procession route</span></p><p><span>The King and Queen Consort took a 1.3-mile route to the ceremony.</span></p><p><span>They travelled down the Mall via Admiralty Arch, took the south side of Trafalgar Square, went along Whitehall and Parliament Street, took the east and south sides of Parliament Square to Broad Sanctuary, before arriving at the abbey.</span></p><p><span>The Queen took a much longer route after her coronation, travelling five miles through Whitehall, Trafalgar Square, Pall Mall, Hyde Park Corner, Marble Arch, Oxford Circus, and finally down the Mall to end at Buckingham Palace.</span></p><p><span>The new King and queen used the Diamond Jubilee State Coach on their way to the ceremony.</span><span class="contradicted highlight" id="highlight-16">For the way back, the 260-year-old Gold State Coach was chosen.</span></p><p><span>Spectators got wet</span></p><p><span>Viewing spots along the procession route were in high demand - particularly as the royals took a shorter journey than the late Queen in 1953.</span></p><p><span class="contradicted highlight" id="highlight-19">Outside Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace as well as along the Mall, the Horse Guards Parade and Parliament Square were all prime spots, with royal fans pitched up and getting soaking wet.</span></p><p><span>A muted flypast</span></p><p><span>More than 60 aircraft were expected to take to the sky over London - but bad weather meant a slimmed-down flypast.</span></p><p><span class="supported highlight" id="highlight-22">The display opened with helicopters cutting through the low cloud over the palace, before the Red Arrows soared overhead trailing red, white and blue.</span></p><p><span>The flypast lasted for less than three minutes - when it was scheduled to last for more than six.</span></p><p><span>The much-awaited balcony moment</span></p><p><span class="supported highlight" id="highlight-25">Exactly who would appear on the balcony was shrouded in mystery until the moment the Royal Family stepped out.</span></p><p><span>Speculation had been rife as to why the palace did not announce who would be up there, with some claiming it could be a ploy to eschew newspaper headlines indicating Prince Harry had been "banned" from the balcony.</span></p><p><span>The King and Queen were met with roars from the waiting crowd as they appeared on the balcony for the first time after the coronation.</span></p><p><span class="contradicted highlight" id="highlight-28">To the right of the King and Queen stood the Prince and Princess of Wales, and their children Prince Louis and Charlotte.</span></p><p><span>With them stood the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, the Earl of Wessex and Lady Louise Windsor.</span></p><p><span>The eight pages of honour stood closest to the King and Queen, including second in line to the throne, Prince George, and Camilla's grandchildren.</span></p><p><span class="contradicted highlight" id="highlight-31">To the right of the King and Queen stood Prince and Princess Michael of Kent - the Prince is the late Queen's cousin.</span></p><p><span>Stood behind Camilla were her ladies in attendance - her sister Annabel Elliot and longtime friend and current Queen's companion Lady Lansdowne.</span></p><p><span>What else will happen over the coronation weekend?</span></p><p><span>Sunday 7 May</span></p><p><span>Monday 8 May</span></p><p><span>Tell me more about the concert</span></p><p><span>The coronation concert will see music stars descend on Windsor Castle, with Take That, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie on the line-up.</span></p><p><span>It will also feature "the coronation choir", a diverse group of community choirs and amateur singers from across the UK, including refugee choirs, NHS choirs, LGBTQ+ singing groups and deaf signing choirs.</span></p><p><span>The audience will be made up of 10,000 people drawn from a ticket ballot, along with volunteers from charities affiliated to the King and Queen.</span></p><p><span>More information about the concert here.</span></p><p><span>Where was it shown on a big screen?</span></p><p><span>The government provided funding for big screens at more than 60 locations across the UK.</span></p><p><span>Parks, town squares and libraries were all transformed into coronation viewing venues, with crowds gathering despite damp weather across much of the country.</span></p><p><span>When is the bank holiday?</span></p><p><span>The Monday after the coronation - 8 May 2023 - will be a bank holiday for all of the UK.</span></p><p><span class="supported highlight" id="highlight-46">The day has been set aside for volunteering and is being billed as "The Big Help Out", with people encouraged to pitch in with projects in their local communities.</span></p><p><span>Will the pubs be open later?</span></p><p><span>Pubs will be allowed to stay open until 1am for the weekend.</span></p><p><span>People will be able to enjoy an "extra pint or two" between Friday 5 May and Sunday 7 May, Home Secretary Suella Braverman said.</span></p><p><span>Extending closing time for two hours beyond the normal 11pm was backed by 77% of the public who took part in a month-long consultation.</span></p><p><span>Who was at the coronation - was Harry there?</span></p><p><span class="ambig highlight" id="highlight-52">Prince Harry was at the coronation, while Meghan stayed in California with their children.</span></p><p><span>Westminster Abbey's 2,200 seats were filled with members of the Royal Family, the prime minister, representatives from the Houses of Parliament, heads of state, other royals from around the world and people with links to the royal couple or the charities they support.</span></p><p><span class="contradicted highlight" id="highlight-54">Ant and Dec, Lionel Richie, Stereophonics singer Kelly Jones, Vogue's UK editor Edward Enninful and the magician Dynamo were among the famous faces at Westminster Abbey.</span></p><p><span>They were on the guest list because of their connection with the Prince's Trust.</span></p><p><span>More than 850 community and charity representatives were also invited, including the "boy in the tent", who raised more than £750,000 for North Devon Hospice by camping in his garden for three years.</span></p><p><span>Invitees received an invitation that was handwritten by calligraphers from London Scribes Calligraphers, using traditional italic dip pens and bespoke mixed inks.</span></p><p><span>Veterans and NHS workers were front row in 3,800 seats in a specially built grandstand in front of Buckingham Palace.</span></p><p><span>Was Queen Camilla's ex-husband there?</span></p><p><span>Yes.</span><span>Andrew Parker Bowles was there to watch the crowning of the new king and queen.</span></p><p><span>He was also present at their wedding in 2005.</span></p><p><span>Here's more about Andrew and the Parker Bowles family.</span></p><p><span>What's in the ceremony?</span></p><p><span class="supported highlight" id="highlight-65">Like every coronation in the last 900 years, the ceremony for the King took place at Westminster Abbey, where the Queen's funeral was held in September and where the Prince and Princess of Wales married in 2011.</span></p><p><span class="supported highlight" id="highlight-66">The service was conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury, a position currently held by Justin Welby.</span><span>The Archbishop of Canterbury has presided over almost every coronation since the Norman Conquest in 1066.</span></p><p><span>The Earl Marshal - the Duke of Norfolk - is in overall charge of the coronation.</span></p><p><span>He is Oxford-educated father-of-five Edward Fitzalan-Howard, 67, and was responsible for organising Elizabeth II's funeral, as well as the Accession and State Openings of Parliament.</span></p><p><span>He was banned from driving for six months in September for using his mobile phone behind the wheel despite claiming he needed his licence to arrange the upcoming coronation.</span></p><p><span>This is the order of service here.</span></p><p><span class="ambig highlight" id="highlight-72">Why was Camilla also crowned?</span></p><p><span>According to the Royal Family's website: "A Queen Consort is crowned with the King, in a similar, but simpler ceremony."</span></p><p><span>The last Queen Consort to be crowned was the Queen Mother alongside King George VI in 1937.</span></p><p><span>Find out more about why Camilla was also crowned here.</span></p><p><span>What happens during a coronation?</span></p><p><span>There are six basic phases to the coronation: the recognition, the oath, the anointing, the investiture (which includes the crowning), the enthronement and the homage.</span></p><p><span class="ambig highlight" id="highlight-78">During the ceremony, the King swore to uphold the law and the Church of England, was anointed with holy oil, received the Royal Orb and sceptres and was crowned with the solid gold St Edward's Crown.</span><span>Read more about the crowning ceremony here.</span></p><p><span class="contradicted highlight" id="highlight-80">More than 50 people, including representatives from orders of chivalry, the military and wider public life, were chosen to take part in the historic event, and were selected because of their "significant service", the palace said.</span></p><p><span>Among them was TV presenter Floella Benjamin, former MI5 chief Baroness Elizabeth Manningham-Buller and Lincolnshire farmer Francis Dymoke.</span></p><p><span class="contradicted highlight" id="highlight-82">Mr Dymoke, as he is the owner of the Scrivelsby country estate, was the King's champion and carried the Royal Standard.</span></p><p><span>In the procession into Westminster Abbey, faith leaders and representatives went first followed by governors-general, prime ministers and flag bearers from each of the 15 realms where the King is head of state.</span></p><p><span>Ahead of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his wife Akshata Murty, the UK's flag bearer was Cadet Warrant Officer Elliott Tyson-Lee.</span></p><p><span>The King and Queen Consort's procession followed, led by the Marquess of Anglesey, the Duke of Westminster, the Earl of Caledon and the Earl of Dundee, who carried the Standards of the Quarterings of the Royal Arms and the Standard of the Principality of Wales.</span></p><p><span>How was it different to the Queen's coronation in 1953?</span></p><p><span class="contradicted highlight" id="highlight-87">While the 1953 coronation was three hours long and had 8,000 guests in attendance, the ceremony for the King was shorter and smaller in scope.</span></p><p><span class="contradicted highlight" id="highlight-88">The Queen's coronation was the first to be televised and was credited with bringing TV into the mainstream.</span></p><p><span>More than 20 million people watched the service on television, many crowded around neighbours' screens, outnumbering the radio audience for the first time.</span></p><p><span>How to watch all the coronation events on TV</span></p><p><span>In a milestone for TV broadcasting, Sky customers were able to watch the King and Queen crowned in the clarity of Ultra HD, for free on Sky News channel 501.</span></p><p><span>Multiple live streams were also available on the Sky News website, app and on our YouTube channel.</span></p><p><span>Joanna Lumley joined Sky News presenters for the coverage.</span></p><p><span class="contradicted highlight" id="highlight-94">The Absolutely Fabulous actress, who provided commentary for Sky News for the Queen's Jubilee last year, attended the service at Westminster Abbey in May as a guest of Charles and Camilla.</span></p><p><span>Dame Joanna, 76, then joined the broadcaster's coronation line-up, which includes royal events commentator Alastair Bruce and presenters Kay Burley and Anna Botting.</span></p><p><span class="contradicted highlight" id="highlight-96">Every aspect of the big day was televised, from royal fans gathering in the streets to the ceremony and processions.</span></p><p><span>To stay up-to-date with the coronation - including details like timings of the day, news,
