    <h1>ML Tutorials - learn machine learning</h2>
    <h2>Sometimes I get frustrated with the state of machine learning tutorials on the web. Many of them seem either designed for people with too much experience, or for people with too little. Many of them are too specific, offering only a single solution to a specific problem for a specific dataset — making it difficult for learners to generalize. And many are too general, without concrete code examples to explain the techniques.</h2>
    <h2>Furthermore, they're never really targeted at people who are both researchers and software engineers, often failing to combine theory and practice effectively and completely ignoring the wider world of artificial intelligence research.</h2>
    <h2>So, out of frustration, I've decided to design some of my own tutorials and link to some of the best ones around the web. I haven't written them all yet, but I am actively working on it. They're mostly follow-along jupyter notebooks. You don't have to read these in order. They link around to each other, and to other work on the web.</h2>
