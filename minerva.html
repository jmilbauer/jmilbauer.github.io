    <h1>Minerva - knowledge, now</h2>
    <h2>I've always found it a bit shocking that something like Wikipedia — an astounding compendium of human knowledge — is not more integrated into our daily lives. It wasn't until recently that Google search even incorporated Wikipedia articles into their search results. There's no way, at the moment, to augment your life — and the things you see and read — with the additional layer of information offered by something like Wikipedia</h2>
    <h2>In order to fix this problem, I've begun building Minerva. The goal is to surface relevant knowledge automatically and naturally, without having to explicitly search for something.</h2>
    <h2>By leveraging state-of-the-art language models, Minerva is able to use a Naive Bayes Classifier to solve a problem the local Disambiguation to Wikipedia problem in a way that is simple, elegant, and fast enough to run in a web browser.</h2>
    <h2>>>></h2>
    <h3>Phase 1: Disambiguation to Wikipedia (complete!)</h3>
    <h3>Phase 1.5: Browser compatibility</h3>
    <h3>Phase 2: Keyword Recognition</h3>
    <h3>Phase 3: Browser Extension</h3>
    <h3>Phase n: Further knowledge layers.</h3>
