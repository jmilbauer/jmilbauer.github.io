id="highlight-110">LONDON — The eyes of the world will be on the U.K. this weekend as King Charles III is crowned at Westminster Abbey in a quintessentially British display of pomp and pageantry.</span></p><p><span class="ambig highlight" id="highlight-111">The coronation, which will be conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury on Saturday May 6, will kickstart three days of celebrations across London and the wider U.K., culminating in a public holiday on May 8.</span></p><p><span>The service — the first of its kind in 70 years — is largely ceremonial, following the 74-year-old king's official accession to the throne on September 8, 2022, the day of Queen Elizabeth II's death.</span></p><p><span>But while millions are expected to observe the historic occasion, it falls against a challenging economic backdrop for the U.K, with many questioning the validity of the event as the country faces its worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation.</span></p><p><span>Buckingham Palace does not provide an exact figure for the cost of the coronation, nor did it respond to CNBC's request for comment.</span></p><p><span class="ambig highlight" id="highlight-115">However, King Charles himself is said to have sought a more scaled-back celebration, with a "shorter," "smaller, less expensive and more representative" ceremony — part of his wider plans for a slimmed down monarchy.</span></p><p><span>The Westminster Abbey ceremony, for instance, will be attended by some 2,000 VIP guests — around a quarter of the number present at the late queen's coronation — and the process will last around one hour, rather than several.</span></p><p><span class="supported highlight" id="highlight-117">Still, the expense of the weekend's proceedings — which include a "King's procession" and a star-studded concert in Windsor Gardens — are expected to run to between £50 million and £100 million ($63-125 million), according to estimates cited by the BBC which it said was not from an official source.</span></p><p><span>That's potentially more than the approximately £50 million in today's money — then £1.5 million — spent when the queen took the throne in 1953.</span></p><p><span>It's also well above the equivalent £24.8 million — then £450,000 — spent on George VI's coronation in 1937.</span></p><p><span class="supported highlight" id="highlight-120">The occasion, like most public events, is funded by the U.K. government and, ultimately, the British taxpayer, with Buckingham Palace also contributing an undisclosed share.</span></p><p><span>That has disgruntled some Brits, with 51% saying the coronation should not be funded by the government, according to a recent YouGov poll, while 18% were undecided.</span></p><p><span>Meantime, the public holiday called to mark the event on May 8 is estimated the cost the U.K. economy a further £1.36 billion in lost productivity.</span></p><p><span>Currently, U.K. gross domestic product (GDP) stands around 0.6% below its level of late-2019, and it is the only G-7 economy not to have recovered from the Covid-induced slump.</span><span>Inflation, meanwhile, remains stubbornly high, with the headline rate rising 10.1% annually in March, and food and beverage costs rising at the sharpest clip in 45 years.</span></p><p><span>The government, for its part, however, insists that the occasion will bring in millions for businesses, particularly the hard-hit retail, tourism and hospitality sectors.</span><span>According to some estimates, retail sales are typically boosted by around 15% per day on public holidays.</span></p><p><span>UK Hospitality, a trade association for the hospitality industry, said that the king's coronation could bring a £350 million boost to the sector.</span><span>That, combined with Britain's two further May bank holidays, as well as the Eurovision Song Contest in Liverpool on May 13, could generate a total boost of £1 billion, it added.</span></p><p><span>— CNBC's Gaelle Legrand contributed to this report.</span></p><p><span>Got a confidential
